## instructions

The 'log' is a scratch pad where you jot down observations, problems, solutions, links that help you, anything really, as you work through the relevant tutorials. **It is ok if you get stuck** when doing the tutorials; your log is what enables me to help you overcome the challenges. Your log gives me a glimpse into your workflow and practice. Hit the pencil icon to edit this document.

It can be helpful to drag-and-drop screenshots of your work when you hit an error. On a mac, hit cmd + 4 to highlight the area of the screen you want to screenshot; on a Windows machine, you can hit the windows key + g to do the same thing. Drag and drop the screenshot into this folder. You can embed the image into this text file by following this pattern:

`![](the-screenshot-filename.png)`

Once you hit the 'commit' button, Github will embed the image. **nb** nothing saves unless you hit the commit button.

## Log for Part Two

#### Name of Tutorial

**Things that challenged me:**
<br /> 
- had a hard time finding a diary that I enjoy, especially when the list does not provide any key information, after a long search I finally found one that interests me but the download files were janky
- the download jpg urls were all different and not just the id number but the entire webpage. Had to use python to exerpt the urls using the htdml coding of it.
- wget was being very difficult, I checked my previous logs and it helped.
**Where I went for help:**
- previous notes and discord.
