Digital history was a foreign subject that comforts the idea of technological data collection and history together. I had plenty of data visualization experience in my past through tableau, datawrapper, and open refine; I was able to create stories that inference to answers answers and more questions.

The project allows us to discover and research historical finding through the different tools tought to us throughout the class. The diary I have selected is Ebenezer Storer between 1749-1784. Ebenezer was a graduate from Harvard University, as well as an ad eundem degree from Yale. His diary entry consists mostly of the death of his family as well as providing meditations on death and other spiritual matters. Drawing me to this diary is his poetry throughout the transcript and his realization for a spiritual world.
